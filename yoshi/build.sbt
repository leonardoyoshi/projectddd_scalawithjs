//Of course, first weâ€™ll need to declare some dependencies to use slick,
// play-slick, and mysql - the chosen database for us. Add these 3 dependencies to your build.sbt
//Also, if you have a jdbc dependency declared in
// your build.sbt file, remove it, or it will cause some errors in the compilation.
